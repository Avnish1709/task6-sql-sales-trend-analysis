## 🧰 Tools Used

- 🛠 MySQL (via db-fiddle.com)  
- 💻 Notepad (for writing and saving `.sql` file)  
- 🖼 Screenshot Tool (for capturing query outputs)  
- 🌐 GitHub (for submission)  

---

## 🔍 SQL Concepts Used

- `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`
- `YEAR()`, `MONTH()` for date grouping
- `LIMIT`, `WHERE` clause
- `COALESCE()` for handling NULLs

## 📜 Queries Executed

1. Create table and insert sample data  
2. Monthly revenue and total order volume  
3. Top 3 months by revenue  
4. Sales trend in year 2019  
5. Sales between January and March (Q1)  
6. Handling NULL values in sales  
👉 All queries are saved in: `task6_queries.sql`
